When generating commit messages, always use the Conventional Commits format:
- Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build
- Optionally include a scope in parentheses
- Follow with a colon and space, then a lowercase description
- Example: feat(auth): add password reset flow
- Example: fix: resolve null pointer in user hook
